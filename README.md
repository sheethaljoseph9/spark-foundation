# spark-foundation-tasks

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
- Internship Duration - 1 Month ( October-2020 )
- Internship Type - Work from Home
In this internship, we were provided a total of 6 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 6 tasks within the given time-frame.

# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
- Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
- Data can be found at (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv) 
- You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
- What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
- From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
- Use R or Python or perform this task.
- Data can be found at (https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j)

# Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
- For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
